            If we rever what makes us feel<br>
            Praise only what elicits tears<br>
            Whose display of pain brings near<br>
            All who bleed to be clear<br>
            The cuts we see<br>
            Heartache we feel<br>
            To teach trauma<br>
            To those most hurt<br>
            Needless drama<br>
            Makes an expert<br>
            To gauge a souls depth<br>
            With only it's torment<br>
            Seems what we love most is loss<br>
            When what we lose most is love<br>
            All we take from the rose cross<br>
            Is it's sacrificial cost<br>
            Called the warmth of god<br>
            He who suffers most<br>
            Knows hope<br>
            He whose hopes are high<br>
            Suffers pride<br>
            For them that have no hope<br>
            Sufferings nigh<br>
            Form them that suffer none<br>
            Do the suffering buy<br>
            Over the hopeful<br>
            The hopeless climb<br>
            Not by strength or perseverance<br>
            But sheer dogged stupidity<br>
            Unaware of those who stopped<br>
            Ignorant entirely of why<br>
            Saw not the top<br>
            But the other side<br>
            And hate not the climb<br>
            But the slide back down<br>
            Even those that fly can fall<br>
            With your head turned skyward<br>
            You forget the ground<br>
            Falling to feel like you flew<br>
            Moving the mountain<br>
            To prove that you could<br>
            Up there the air is thin<br>
            Like the wind in your sail<br>
            You contort yourself to exist<br>
            You extort yourself to predict<br>
            What the self fulfilled<br>
            Would say to the self unheard<br>
            Until the words come from within<br>
            Without which you couldn't tell<br>
            Your self from the rain cloud<br>
            But now you're the umbrella<br>
            The mind once an orchestra<br>
            Now sings a cappella<br>
            But the tune never changes<br>
            Just the way it's sung<br>
        </p>
