        <h1>A Stumble Through the Follies</h1>

        <p>
            As I've stumbled through my follies<br>
            And shinned the errors of my ways<br>
            I've grown found my stupidity<br>
            And the lessons it once gave<br>
            <br>

            Though back when I was bright eyed<br>
            And could talk myself a shiner<br>
            I would curse myself an idiot<br>
            For not shining any brighter<br>
            <br>

            So I sought the very brightest<br>
            And surrounded myself in light<br>
            I couldn't seen then in the slightest<br>
            Or sleep without the night<br>
            <br>

            My eyes grew very tired<br>
            No longer strong enough to squint<br>
            And the air was getting hotter<br>
            Even harsher than the glint<br>
            <br>

            Eventually the power failed<br>
            And everything went dark<br>
            The heavens were in free fall<br>
            And hell a skating park<br>
            <br>

            Gradually as our eyes adjusted<br>
            I saw it in the distance<br>
            The softest wisp of illumination<br>
            Flickering into existence<br>
            <br>

            I was startled as I approached it<br>
            And the glow grew fervent<br>
            I heard the flow of running water<br>
            Not the buzz of electrical current<br>
            <br>

            I was baffled for a moment<br>
            Wading there in the stream<br>
            I could see it clearly in the water<br>
            A pool of light with no beam<br>
            <br>

            It struck me like lighting<br>
            When I got back to land<br>
            Surrounded by fireflies<br>
            My brightly glowing hand<br>
            <br>

            A whip crack and a fizzle<br>
            As the grid set alight<br>
            And I was once again the dimmest<br>
            Daytime night light<br>


            So I wondered to the forest<br>
            Until I could see only me<br>
            The canopy much stronger there<br>
            Then the golden light beams<br>
            <br>

            As I reveled in my illumination<br>
            And the wind began to stir<br>
            then suddenly the ground erupted<br>
            Neon coated conifers<br>
            <br>

            The fireflies they'll guide you<br>
            Where the night invibes a glow<br>
            Then as the inner light grows brighter<br>
            You'll know clearly where to go<br>
            <br>

            In cast light you miss the shapes<br>
            Which are shadows in themselves<br>
            They cannot reflect they only hold inside<br>
            Until dark has fully fell<br>
            <br>

            Then it alone can signal you<br>
            From above as so below<br>
            There's no destruction here no heat to bear<br>
            Phosphorescent just as so<br>


            I returned to home much duller now<br>
            For I have seen the truth<br>
            All this electric light to hide the fact<br>
            That darkness is proof<br>


            You need only to hold your light inside<br>
            And cherish the inward beam<br>
            Then I promise you, when you need it most<br>
            What you need to know, you will gleem<br>
            <br>

            For it's that parts of you that can't reflect<br>
            That absorb the colors seen<br>
            And it's through them that you learn to share<br>
            The light you've come to see<br>
            <br>

            So walk from here to the place you know<br>
            Deep down and hid away<br>
            And sit with grief till it smiles at you<br>
            Then you'll know it's name<br>
            <br>

            Love in all its wickedness<br>
            That which heals and which maims<br>
            The strongest light that a humans might<br>
            Could ever claim to tame<br>
