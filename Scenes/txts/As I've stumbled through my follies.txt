As I've stumbled through my follies
And shinned the errors of my ways
I've grown found my stupidity
And the lessons it once gave


Though back when I was bright eyed
And could talk myself a shiner
I would curse myself an idiot
For not shining any brighter


So I sought the very brightest
And surrounded myself in light
I couldn't seen then in the slightest
Or sleep without the night


My eyes grew very tired
No longer strong enough to squint
And the air was getting hotter
Even harsher than the glint


Eventually the power failed
And everything went dark
The heavens were in free fall
And hell a skating park


Gradually as our eyes adjusted
I saw it in the distance
The softest wisp of illumination
Flickering into existence


I was startled as I approached it
And the glow grew fervent
I heard the flow of running water
Not the buzz of electrical current


I was baffled for a moment
Wading there in the stream
I could see it clearly in the water
A pool of light with no beam


It struck me like lighting
When I got back to land
Surrounded by fireflies
My brightly glowing hand


A whip crack and a fizzle
As the grid set alight
And I was once again the dimmest
Daytime night light


So I wondered to the forest
Until I could see only me
The canopy much stronger there
Then the golden light beams


As I reveled in my illumination
And the wind began to stir
then suddenly the ground erupted
Neon coated conifers


The fireflies they'll guide you
Where the night invibes a glow
Then as the inner light grows brighter
You’ll know clearly where to go


In cast light you miss the shapes
Which are shadows in themselves
They cannot reflect they only hold inside
Until dark has fully fell


Then it alone can signal you
From above as so below
There's no destruction here no heat to bear
Phosphorescent just as so


I returned to home much duller now
For I have seen the truth
All this electric light to hide the fact
That darkness is proof


You need only to hold your light inside
And cherish the inward beam
Then I promise you, when you need it most
What you need to know, you will gleem


For it's that parts of you that can't reflect
That absorb the colors seen
And it's through them that you learn to share
The light you've come to see


So walk from here to the place you know
Deep down and hid away
And sit with grief till it smiles at you
Then you'll know it's name


Love in all its wickedness
That which heals and which maims
The strongest light that a humans might
Could ever claim to tame
