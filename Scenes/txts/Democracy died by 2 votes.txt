Democracy died by the vote
The uroboros implodes
Public sentiment rejected
Judgements based on complexion
Liberty cries out in pain
Gagged and shackled by chains
Democracy died by the vote
Decency dies all alone


The watch dogs bark loudly
But the leash is much stronger
Children fight back their cages
Parents beat for much longer
The tired huddled masses
Indebted to fascists
Prey upon the praying
To feed the upper classes
Natzis are praised for thier passion and tactics
Supremacist notions woven into the fabric
The dictator reigns with his morals of acid
The rain we now feel 
On our ball made of plastic
The oceans are shrinking
But so is the land
Pinched between fingers
Of a God who's a man
The earth mourns itself failing
In the bleakness of war unabating
The rusty red rivers of blood are not dry
The power of money the only known to survive
The sun it feels hotter
Though it's known to be cooling
And the air we once breathed 
Is now toxic, polluting 


Democracy died by the vote
The uroboros implodes
Public sentiment rejected
Judgements based on completion 
Liberty cries out in pain
Gagged and shackled by chains
Democracy died by the vote
Decency dies all alone


News coverage is skimpy
The science is puedo
Their minds are not strong
Their hearts cold as Pluto
God died in 1882
140 years later 
A fact that's still true
But the earth is now flat
And vaccines are a poison
The old flags been burned
A new ones been hoisted
Eugenics is is back and it's badder than ever
Fast food and fast women 
Growing fatter than ever
Contraception is contraband
But a baby is useless
More burning books
And all that's a nuisance 
Logic and reason can't drive it all home
But under the hammer
You don't question what's known
 
Democracy died by the vote
