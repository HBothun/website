The link which was cut 
never clanked to the ground
The door still bolted shut
I did not hear a sound


It crept up like moss
Engulfing me soft
It held me and pleaded
I gave in, it recessed


I felt my soul swelling
And twirling me carelessly
Caressing me endlessly
Lying acquiescently 


But the truth is I listened
And thought it all might be real
I should've realized then
Where and when it would seal


guess I'm just a fool
Who's blind to the facts
For an emotionally unequipped
Audience to boo at


I suppose I'm a clown
And I'm stuck in my box
Miming a smile
For a dog who can talk


I always tried to be kind
never tell one to act right
Cause with time I find
Truth is like midnight


It's darker than most time
And quiet as a mouse
You know now in hindsight
What's home vs house
