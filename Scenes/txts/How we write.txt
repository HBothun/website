If we rever what makes us feel
Praise only what elicits tears
Whose display of pain brings near
All who bleed to be clear
The cuts we see
Heartache we feel
To teach trauma
To those most hurt
Needless drama
Makes an expert
To gauge a souls depth
With only it's torment
Seems what we love most is loss
When what we lose most is love
All we take from the rose cross
Is it's sacrificial cost
Called the warmth of god
He who suffers most
Knows hope
He whose hopes are high
Suffers pride
For them that have no hope
Sufferings nigh
Form them that suffer none
Do the suffering buy
Over the hopeful
The hopeless climb
Not by strength or perseverance
But sheer dogged stupidity
Unaware of those who stopped
Ignorant entirely of why
Saw not the top
But the other side
And hate not the climb
But the slide back down
Even those that fly can fall
With your head turned skyward
You forget the ground
Falling to feel like you flew
Moving the mountain
To prove that you could
Up there the air is thin
Like the wind in your sail
You contort yourself to exist
You extort yourself to predict
What the self fulfilled
Would say to the self unheard
Until the words come from within
Without which you couldn't tell
Your self from the rain cloud
But now you're the umbrella
The mind once an orchestra
Now sings a cappella
But the tune never changes
Just the way it’s sung
