I once had great insight
But am now without
I once knew so little
Now I have my doubts


I once had aspirations
Now I just perspire
I once had grand intentions
But now I feel so tired


I saw the world on fire
And I felt a sense of duty
So now my hands are burnt
But the world is still burning


I met the dragon young
And I wasn't first in line
But I hit the dragon hard
It sent shivers down my spine


I memorized it's smile
And forgot my own face
seeing my own reflection
Now seems out of place


Once I had the upper hand
But now I bend the knee
Once I had a plan for life
But it had plans for me


I used to think so deeply
Dug straight to the surface
I only thought about my thinking
So thoughtless was my purpose


Now I am content
Not happy or enthralled
Not on the verge of greatness
Just here and that is all
