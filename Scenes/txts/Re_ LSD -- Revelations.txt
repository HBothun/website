Now I'm sure I'm washed up
Nearly as certain as I can swim
Swear I can still see that first leg
To realize and invite the all within
A task I attempted many times
And then it was the second wave
I searched there for the secret
The infinite and ever expanding scope
Once seen, must be quick to find use
Which gives way to waste
That tool once a key
Itself becomes a lock
Once every door has been opened
That which was once experimentation
Becomes insanity
If we can seek communion
Without expectation
If you can grasp the infinite
Without grip
The wheels may turn with great ease
But not without friction
It was the third part of my journey
Which brought me ashore
I saw all that I was and would ever be
Forced to accept that which I now bore
I saw the fabric of time
And plucked my own thread
As it is the only certainty
I hope to deserve my death
That long needed rest
Though I wish I could see
That which gave me myself
And with it a purpose
To find reason
Better to see to the task at hand
Whereas I sought to have seen
That which we cannot
Caused or correlated life is connected
I thought I was the needle
And I’ve come to learn
I'm just a thread
