That pill too hard to swallow
So I wallow in my pillows
It's still too hard to swallow
So weep like I'm a willow
That pill to hard to swallow
I'm too hollow now to feel though
That pill to hard to swallow
So I'm watching all these bills grow


I take no gulps
I ain't the culprit
Ain't my fault
You gotta rough it


But it is and it isn't ain't it
I'm dizzy and constipated
Hella faded
And calibrated for casuals
But correlation is integrated
Disseminated as plausible


I'm honest
Not infallible
I might say some shit to casual
Causing casualties compatible
a concubine you animals


Love birds I get two words
And I can't have them mistaken
Upwards soars wing surls
And I went with “loves amazing”


Shoot my shot Im slick I’m slanging
Hoops are caught up in my tangles
Hopes are high as I am able
To muster
No covers
Y'all busted
Young lovers


That pill to hard to swallow
So you wondering how they learn it
But it’s still too hard to swallow
And your eyes are really burning
That pill to hard to swallow
They just grow up so fast
That pill to hard to swallow
getting high prior to class


No respect for empty teachers
Undeserving of its features
They go to school to grab that knowledge
Leave their textbook in they lockers
Don’t do they homework lest they gotta
Study hour had some problems
Acting out to get detention
No one notices retention


Y’all assuming kids be stupid
Bet they know way more then me
Inteletic is just perception
Do you see them miss a beat?


Maybe in lessons and dynamics
Old white system make them panic
Read your books and let them plant it
Don’t have fun they just can't stand it


Can you remember when to stop
While you're challenging every thought?
This aint the world that we were raised in
Same old tactics nothing changing


Half of education is erasing
What they learn in social places
Cause it’s wrong and it's offensive 
But the programming’s elastic
Snap to form when someone's asking
How these people look so plastic
You ain’t happy we ain’t happy
Why the fuck we gotta mask it?


That pill to hard to swallow
So they dropping out for drugs
But it's still too hard to swallow
Find a doctor hit them up
Bet that pill be hard to swallow
Doc my kids been acting up
And it’s all too hard to swallow
Being myself just ain’t enough


So you get spat out to the world
Hurtling hate from every borough
You don't feel like you belong here
Imperfections way to thorough


Plus your self worth is all relative
And your head hurts when your selling shit
Lies flow like resumes
But i’m a happy man when I’m getting paid


Plus people famous for like half a day
Cause daddy love them and paved the way
Or you tapping shit trying make a buck
Only making love cause you can’t give a fuck


People want you dead
Trying to change your head trying make your bed
Have you laying down to slumber
Stealing your social security number


Credit score is a negative
Fraud the only prerogative
Man your moneys why you knocking it


NRA’s got their ku klux profit
Pfizer's got all their consultants
But weed can't be no constant
The only racket people stopping 
Everybody want some money
Only certain people got pockets


That pill to hard to swallow 
So you're wondering the streets
And it’s still too hard to swallow
Wish I had something to drink
That pills to hard to swallow
It’s a crime the way I think
Man the pills so hard to swallow
I can't find no place to sleep


The earth is dying
We’re divorced, it took the house
Children crying all around
The debt is flying and these rates ain’t come down


But democracy might be
Running their clean cole with hate speech
Caught in nightly cycles
Of shade throwing mic screams


The feedbacks got filters
My job apps got filters
My head shots we’re cheap AF
But my instagram still killer
Social currency the filler
So these poor people can't filter


Through the cracks into the mills
Stuffing sacks with honest pills
CIA consuming crack
FBI with truents facs
Man you couldn’t impeach a orange peel
With a senate full of hacks


Orrin Hatch man your wack
Not to mention Mitch Mconnel


You lost your moral reticle
Aiming at your pitiful
Excuse for what's acceptable


You exist to disrespect
And I expect 
That your demise is just inevitable


You have the power and I hope you don't forget
That when we grab it and it's ours
We will be burning all your shit
Including you


Cause nothing burns like birch bark, man ain’t that the truth
