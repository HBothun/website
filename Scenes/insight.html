        <h1>Once Great Insight</h1>

        <p>
            I once had great insight<br>
            But am now without<br>
            I once knew so little<br>
            Now I have my doubts<br>
            <br>
            I once had aspirations<br>
            Now I just perspire<br>
            I once had grand intentions<br>
            But now I feel so tired<br>
            <br>
            I saw the world on fire<br>
            And I felt a sense of duty<br>
            So now my hands are burnt<br>
            But the world is still burning<br>
            <br>
            I met the dragon young<br>
            And I wasn't first in line<br>
            But I hit the dragon hard<br>
            It sent shivers down my spine<br>
            <br>
            I memorized it's smile<br>
            And forgot my own face<br>
            seeing my own reflection<br>
            Now seems out of place<br>
            <br>
            Once I had the upper hand<br>
            But now I bend the knee<br>
            Once I had a plan for life<br>
            But it had plans for me<br>
            <br>
            I used to think so deeply<br>
            Dug straight to the surface<br>
            I only thought about my thinking<br>
            So thoughtless was my purpose<br>
            <br>
            Now I am content<br>
            Not happy or enthralled<br>
            Not on the verge of greatness<br>
            Just here and that is all<br>
        </p>
