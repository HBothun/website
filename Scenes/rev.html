        <h1>Revelations</h1>

        <p>
            Now I'm sure I'm washed up<br>
            Nearly as certain as I can swim<br>
            Swear I can still see that first leg<br>
            To realize and invite the all within<br>
            A task I attempted many times<br>
            And then it was the second wave<br>
            I searched there for the secret<br>
            The infinite and ever expanding scope<br>
            Once seen, must be quick to find use<br>
            Which gives way to waste<br>
            That tool once a key<br>
            Itself becomes a lock<br>
            Once every door has been opened<br>
            That which was once experimentation<br>
            Becomes insanity<br>
            If we can seek communion<br>
            Without expectation<br>
            If you can grasp the infinite<br>
            Without grip<br>
            The wheels may turn with great ease<br>
            But not without friction<br>
            It was the third part of my journey<br>
            Which brought me ashore<br>
            I saw all that I was and would ever be<br>
            Forced to accept that which I now bore<br>
            I saw the fabric of time<br>
            And plucked my own thread<br>
            As it is the only certainty<br>
            I hope to serve my death<br>
            That long needed rest<br>
            Though I wish I could see<br>
            That which gave me myself<br>
            And with it, a purpose<br>
            To find reason or<br>
            Better to see to the task at hand<br>
            Whereas I sought to have seen<br>
            That which one cannot<br>
            Caused or correlated life is connected<br>
            I thought I was the needle<br>
            And I've come to learn<br>
            I'm just a thread<br>
