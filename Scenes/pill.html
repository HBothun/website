        <h1>Hard Pill to Swallow</h1>

        <p>
            That pill too hard to swallow<br>
            So I wallow in my pillows<br>
            It's still too hard to swallow<br>
            So weep like I'm a willow<br>
            That pill to hard to swallow<br>
            I'm too hollow now to feel though<br>
            That pill to hard to swallow<br>
            So I'm watching all these bills grow<br>
            <br>
            I take no gulps<br>
            I ain't the culprit<br>
            Ain't my fault<br>
            You got it rough<br>
            I got it rough<br>
            <br>
            But it is and it isn't ain't it<br>
            I'm dizzy and constipated<br>
            And calibrated for casuals<br>
            correlation is integrated<br>
            Disseminated as plausible<br>
            <br>
            I'm honest<br>
            Not infallible<br>
            I might say some shit to casual<br>
            Causing casualties comparable compatible<br>
            a concubine you animal<br>
            <br>
            That pill to hard to swallow<br>
            So you wondering how they learn it<br>
            But it's still too hard to swallow<br>
            And your eyes are really burning<br>
            That pill to hard to swallow<br>
            They just grow up so fast<br>
            That pill to hard to swallow<br>
            getting high prior to class<br>
            <br>
            No respect for empty teachers<br>
            Undeserving of its features<br>
            They go to school to grab that knowledge<br>
            Leave their textbook in they lockers<br>
            No they homework lest they gotta<br>
            Study hour had some problems<br>
            Acting out to get detention<br>
            No one notices retention<br>
            <br>
            Y'all assuming kids be stupid<br>
            Bet they know way more then me<br>
            Inteletic is just perception<br>
            Do you see them miss a beat?<br>
            <br>
            Maybe in lessons and dynamics<br>
            Old white system make them panic<br>
            Read your books and let them plant it<br>
            Don't have fun they just can't stand it
            <br>
            Can you remember when to stop<br>
            While you're challenging every thought?<br>
            This aint the world that you were raised in<br>
            still same old tactics nothing changing<br>
            <br>
            Half of education is erasing<br>
            What they learn in social places<br>
            Cause it's wrong and it's offensive <br>
            But the programming's elastic<br>
            Snap to form when someone's asking<br>
            How these people look so plastic<br>
            You ain't happy we ain't happy<br>
            WSo why do we have to mask it?<br>
            <br>
            That pill to hard to swallow<br>
            So they dropping out for drugs<br>
            But it's still too hard to swallow<br>

            Bet that pill be hard to swallow<br>
            Doc my kids been acting up<br>
            And it's all too hard to swallow<br>
            Being myself just ain't enough<br>
            <br>
            So you get spat out to the world<br>
            But don't feel like you belong<br>
            Imperfection way to thorough<br>
            <br>
            Plus your self worth is all relative<br>
            And your head hurts when your selling it<br>
            Lies flow like resumes<br>
            But i'm a happy man when I'm getting paid<br>
            <br>
            Plus people famous for like half a day<br>
            Cause daddy love them and paved the way<br>

            <br>
            People want you dead<br>
            Trying to change your head trying make your bed<br>
            Have you laying down to slumber<br>
            All to steal your social security number<br>
            <br>
            Credit score is a negative<br>
            Fraud the only prerogative<br>
            Money's why you'd be knocking it<br>
            <br>
            NRA's got their ku klux profit<br>
            Pfizer's got all their consultants<br>
            But weed can't be no constant<br>
            The only racket people stopping <br>
            Everybody want some money<br>
            Only certain people get pockets<br>
            <br>
            That pill to hard to swallow <br>
            So you're wondering the streets<br>
            And it's still too hard to swallow<br>
            Wish I had something to drink<br>
            That pills to hard to swallow<br>

            <br>
            The earth is dying<br>
            We're divorced, it took the house<br>
            Children crying all around<br>
            The debt is flying, and these rates ain't come down<br>
            <br>
            But democracy might be<br>
            Running their clean coal with hate speech<br>
            Caught in nightly cycles<br>
            Of shade throwing mic screams<br>
            <br>
            The feedbacks got filters<br>
            My job apps got filters<br>
            My head shots we're cheap AF<br>
            But my instagram still killer<br>
            Social currency the filler<br>
            So poor people filter<br>
            <br>
            Through the cracks into the mills<br>
            Stuffing sacks with honest pills<br>
            CIA consuming crack<br>
            FBI with truents facs<br>
            We you couldn't impeach an orange peel<br>
            With a senate full of hacks<br>
            <br>
            You lost your moral reticle<br>
            Aiming at your pitiful<br>
            Excuse for what's acceptable<br>
            <br>
            You exist to disrespect<br>
            And I expect <br>
            That your demise is just inevitable<br>
            <br>
            You have the power and I hope you don't forget<br>
            That when we grab it and it's ours<br>
            We will be burning all your shit<br>
            Including you<br>
            <br>
            Cause nothing burns like birch bark<br>
