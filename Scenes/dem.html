        <h1>Death by Democracy</h1>

        <p>
            Democracy died by the vote<br>
            The uroboros implodes<br>
            Public sentiment rejected<br>
            Judgements based on complexion<br>
            Liberty cries out in pain<br>
            Gagged and shackled by chains<br>
            Democracy died by the vote<br>
            Decency dies all alone<br>
            <br>
            The watch dogs bark loudly<br>
            But the leash is much stronger<br>
            Children fight back their cages<br>
            Parents beat for much longer<br>
            The tired huddled masses<br>
            Indebted to fascists<br>
            Prey upon the praying<br>
            To feed the upper classes<br>
            Natzis are praised for thier passion and tactics<br>
            Supremacist notions woven into the fabric<br>
            The dictator reigns with his morals of acid<br>
            The rain we now feel<br>
            On our ball made of plastic<br>
            The oceans are shrinking<br>
            But so is the land<br>
            Pinched between fingers<br>
            Of a God who's a man<br>
            The earth mourns itself failing<br>
            In the bleakness of war unabating<br>
            The rusty red rivers of blood are not dry<br>
            The power of money the only known to survive<br>
            The sun it feels hotter<br>
            Though it's known to be cooling<br>
            And the air we once breathed<br>
            Is now toxic, polluting<br>
            <br>
            Democracy died by the vote<br>
            The uroboros implodes<br>
            Public sentiment rejected<br>
            Judgements based on completion<br>
            Liberty cries out in pain<br>
            Gagged and shackled by chains<br>
            Democracy died by the vote<br>
            Decency dies all alone<br>
            <br>
            News coverage is skimpy<br>
            The science is puedo<br>
            Their minds are not strong<br>
            Their hearts cold as Pluto<br>
            God died in 1882<br>
            140 years later<br>
            A fact that's still true<br>
            But the earth is now flat<br>
            And vaccines are a poison<br>
            The old flags been burned<br>
            A new ones been hoisted<br>
            Eugenics is is back and it's badder than ever<br>
            Fast food and fast women<br>
            Growing fatter than ever<br>
            Contraception is contraband<br>
            But a baby is useless<br>
            More burning books<br>
            And all that's a nuisance<br>
            Logic and reason can't drive it all home<br>
            But under the hammer<br>
            You don't question what's known<br>
            <br>
            Democracy died by the vote<br>
            The uroboros implodes<br>
            Public sentiment rejected<br>
            Judgements based on complexion<br>
            Liberty cries out in pain<br>
            Gagged and shackled by chains<br>
            Democracy died by the vote<br>
