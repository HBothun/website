        <h1>Broken Chain</h1>

        <p>
            The link which was cut<br>
            never clanked to the ground<br>
            The door still bolted shut<br>
            I did not hear a sound<br>
            <br>
            It crept up like moss<br>
            Engulfing me soft<br>
            It held me and pleaded<br>
            I gave in, it recessed<br>
            <br>
            I felt my soul swelling<br>
            And twirling me carelessly<br>
            Caressing me endlessly<br>
            Lying acquiescently <br>
            <br>
            But the truth is I listened<br>
            And thought it all might be real<br>
            I should've realized then<br>
            Where and when fate was sealed<br>
            <br>
            guess I'm just a fool<br>
            Who's blind to the facts<br>
            For an emotionally unequipped<br>
            Audience to boo at<br>
            <br>
            I suppose I'm a clown<br>
            And I'm stuck in my box<br>
            Miming a smile<br>
            For a dog who can talk<br>
            <br>
            I always tried to be kind<br>
            never get told to act right<br>
            Cause with time I find<br>
            Truth is like midnight<br>
            <br>
            It's darker than most time<br>
            And quiet as a mouse<br>
            You know now in hindsight<br>
            What's home vs house<br>
        </p>
