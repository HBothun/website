# website
this is my website without any of the music or art since those folders are pretty big.
Everything should make snese in the html and css
all the album covers go in styles and the albums are each in a seperate folder to make css referance easy.
paintings all go in sights
the scenes page will be like the sounds page with a "cover" for each story/poem rather then a link to a pdf which you download
